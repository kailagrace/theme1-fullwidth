					    <p>Billy is the perfect blend of resourcefulness and adventurousness. He's both exciting and mellow, challenging and sweet. He's ever loyal and kind- really he's one of the most genuine and upstanding human beings I've ever met. But Billy's never boring. He's the perfect person to teach me about cars, or to travel the world or analyze a favorite podcast with. He will sit with me and watch a marathon of "Game of Thrones" one day, and hike Mount Washington with me the next. He's not only the perfect companion and partner, but he's also a wonderful boyfriend and fiance. When I first met Billy, I knew we had chemistry. After being with him for years, that hasn't faded. It's just been supplemented by the fact that we really work best together. I can't wait to marry him, but I also can't wait to spend life with him. </p>

					    <p>Kaila is a truly amazing and unique person. She is motivated, smart and knows what she wants (I am happy that she wants me!). Kaila shares the same love of nature and adventure that I do, and we are truly at home exploring. She has the ability to make the best of any situation. She makes me feel loved and wanted. Kaila is the person I want to wake up to every morning for the rest of my life. I want nothing more than to make her happy every day. Life is an adventure and I want to spend it with Kaila.</p>

					    <p>The road trip, for me, was a huge one. Billy and I first took our relationship to the road the summer after we met. Billy's parents were kind enough to loan us their minivan, and we went on a road trip across the country. We started in Connecticut, went southwest to Utah/Arizona/Colorado, and then made our way up the west coast all the way to Vancouver, Canada. On the way back, we spent a long time in Canada, but also jaunted down to Montana and back to Niagara Falls. If you're interested in reading more about our time on the road, or just want to get to know us as a couple, check out <a href="https://whereverthetrailleadsus.wordpress.com/tag/darlings-living-the-dash/"> our blog from the trip.</a> It's a fun read, if we do say so ourselves.</p>

				    <p>Our road trip in the van. The road trip we went on brought the two of us very close. Its impossible to not be close on a road trip through some of the most scenic places in the US and Canada. The fact that we were living out of a 20 sq ft. minivan also helped, I'd imagine. The many hours on the road allowed us to get to know each other better. I donâ€™t think there is any better test of a relationship that being in a car with them for 10,000 miles in 30 days.</p>

						    <p>There have been so many funny moments with Billy. For instance, the day I found out he fears ladybugs, or the day we created dance moves for every tool in his toolbox (the hammer and the paintbrush are the obvious winners). </p><p>One of my favorites was when we decided to make a cake together for a cycling team race. Billy had always wanted to make a cake shaped like a Tonka truck (why, I have no idea!), so we did. </p>

						    <p>Night one, two of our friends (who shall remain anonymous) took said cake into the bathroom and cut it open, eating the entire center until it was hollow. They kept the outside intact, hoping that no one would notice! We woke up the next morning to find the cake caving in on itself, and our friends confessed.</p><p> One of my other favorite things is playing radio games with him. We have this one where we change the station over and over again, and the first person to name the song or the artist wins points- man, it can get heated!</p>

				    <p>The time the mosquitos attacked. Kaila and I woke up in the back of the van on our road trip covered in mosquitos. We had left the windows open a hair for airflow overnight and somehow an army of mosquitos had come in. Kaila, terrified, quickly escaped the van to 'use the bathroom' and left me to take on the mosquitos singlehanded. She came back to me on a rampage swatting around the inside of the van. Many died that day.</p>
