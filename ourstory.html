   						 <p>Billy and I met the August after my Freshman year at UConn. I was a new hire in the University's Outdoors Program, and Billy was the manager at the time. The first time I laid eyes on him, we were asked to start a "staff bonding activity," where we each told the group something about ourselves that was unique. Billy's fact was that he converted a schoolbus and painted it patriotic colors, in order to road trip across the United States. Mine was that I had thirteen grandparents. I remembered him as the handsome, tall, fellow with a really bizarre fun fact. </p>
   						 <p>
   						 Obviously, my fact was memorable too because he used it to start our first conversation later on. We hit it off immediately. Staff training was a week long, but Billy was only at training for two days, so when he left I had a few more days left, enough to wish he were still there! We continued to see each other through work, and Billy asked me on our first official date that following week. </p>

					    <p>It wasn't hard to fall in love with Billy. He took me on a dream first date- the kind that seems too good to be true. We went to the drive-in movies in his pickup truck. I'd prepared by bringing a picnic basket with chocolate milk, which he said he liked, and popcorn, etc. Little did I know he already had a cooler filled to the brim with food and drinks. That was the first indicator I had of how much Billy had it together- he was adventurous and exciting, but always prepared.</p><p>Most of what I remember from that date was that I paid no attention to the movie. We had a chemistry I had never felt with anyone before, and I just liked talking to him, being near him. Both of the films finished, and we decided to drive back and hang out for a while more, just because we didn't want the night to end.</p><p>Fast forward a few weeks, several trips with the mountain biking team, an RV trip in his patriotic schoolbus with our work friends, and a harvest festival in his hometown, and I had fallen for him one hundred and ten percent.</p>

					    <p>Kaila and I quickly hit it off that first weekend of staff training. I was only able to stay the weekend (training was an entire week) because I had an internship to attend. I left that weekend wanting to get to know Kaila more. When the semester started we continued to hit it off and I asked her on a date to the drive-in movies. Kaila had mentioned that she had always wanted to go the drive-in movies in the back of a pickup truck full of blanket and pillows. Conveniently I had a pickup truck and a supply of blankets and pillows to make that happen.</p>

					    <p>It was a shocker! I'd been in Maine at an internship and Billy'd been at work in Connecticut. So, Billy and I were celebrating the end of a summer away from one another with a trip to Nova Scotia. We were in Cape Breton National Park, driving to the most famous trail there- the Skyline trail, when our car started experiencing some issues...We parked it at the trailhead and smoke started pouring out of the front hood. Billy looked at it and determined we had a leak in one of the axle boots. I was frustrated, we were both tired, but we decided to do the hike anyway. We didn't talk much on the way in. I remember thinking that Billy was being pretty quiet, but I was wrapped up in thinking about the car and checking out the scenery. Eventually, we reached a point where there was a lookout to our left, and Billy motioned to me to pull off. I walked forward to the overlook, and was caught up in how beautiful the evening had become. The national park was at its finest- the sun was setting over the impressive mountaintops, and the rocky coast met the ocean and reflected the light from above. Here's a photo, even though it doesn't do much justice:</p>

					</div>	
					   	   						  
						 <p>I asked Billy for a camera, to take a photo. He reached into his bag to get something (presumably, the camera), and his hand emerged with a lovely wooden box instead. He got straight to the point: <blockquote>"Will you marry me?" </blockquote> and I was shocked. My first response, I am embarassed to admit, was to say <blockquote>"Are you for real?!"</blockquote>(Apparently the very-real-looking diamond ring wasn't enough of an indicator that he was "for real.") I gathered myself then, and gave a nervous-looking Billy an "of course!" to which he broke out this grin:</p>

					   	 <p>Long story short, we saw a moose on the way back, the car issues were resolved, and we found a bed to sleep in that night, so it turned out to be a pretty wonderful day. </p>

					    <p>It was hard being away from Kaila while she was at her internship in Maine at Tyler Technologies, and I had known for awhile that I wanted nothing more than to have her be my wife. So, I started ring shopping. This was a big step for a guy who's only previous experience with jewelry was making earrings and a necklace for Kaila out of bike parts. </p><p>We got engaged on an overlook while hiking the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highland National Park. We were on a lookout point and Kaila asked for me to go grab the camera to take a picture of us (it was a beautiful backdrop). I bent down to take the camera out but instead pulled out the ring. I asked her to marry me, and as they say... "the rest was history". We enjoyed one of the most incredible sunsets I've ever seen on the way back.</p>
